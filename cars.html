    <img src="images/rx-7.jpg">
    <p align="center">This is a 1998 Mazda RX-7. These are the best models of the RX-7 in my opinion. They featured a 1.3 L twin-turbo rotary engine.
  This produced around 270 horsepower. These were also produced in Japan and needed to be imported, but it was an easier process than the Skyline.
